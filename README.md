# credit-risk-classification

## This code is designed to train and test a logistic regression model to predict high-risk loans. The initial model is trained on a dataset that has not been balanced for the two loan types, and the final model is trained on a dataset that has been oversampled to balance the two loan types.

# Dependencies

## This code uses Scikit-learn and Imbalanced-learn, as well as Pandas and NumPy.

# Results

## The final model performs very well, with a balanced accuracy score of over 99%. This indicates that the model is able to predict both high-risk and healthy loans with very high accuracy.
